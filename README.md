# Hand-Tracking-Computer-Vision
This repository features a robust, class-based Hand Tracking Module built on top of Google's MediaPipe framework and OpenCV. The project demonstrates how to extract 21 hand landmarks in real-time to create interactive applications, including gesture-based volume control and a Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
